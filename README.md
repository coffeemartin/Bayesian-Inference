The project objectives :

-  Implement the random walk MH algorithm (MCMC), investigate sigma, acceptance rate, and Markov Chain.
-  investigates the influence that the prior can have on the inference in a Bayesian analysis.
-  Using real data to make Bayesian Inference
-  Sample Plots below, Please refer PDF and Rmd files for more details.
